## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/your-repo-name.git
## Install Required Libraries
Make sure you have Python installed. If not, install it from the official Python website.

Once you have Python installed, you can install the required libraries for your Flask app by using pip. Assuming you already have a requirements.txt file or want to manually install each dependency, follow these steps:

## Install Required Libraries

Make sure you have Python installed. If not, install it from the official Python website.

Once you have Python installed, you can install the required libraries for your Flask app by using `pip`. Assuming you already have a `requirements.txt` file or want to manually install each dependency, follow these steps:

### Option 1: Using `requirements.txt`

If you have a `requirements.txt` file that lists all the dependencies for your Flask application, simply run the following command to install them:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Option 2: Manually Installing Dependencies

You can manually install each required library as listed below:

* **Flask**: For creating the web app.
  ```bash
  pip install Flask
  ```

* **pandas**: For handling data (used for CSV or Excel file processing).
  ```bash
  pip install pandas
  ```

* **matplotlib**: For generating graphs or tables in your Flask app.
  ```bash
  pip install matplotlib
  ```

* **openpyxl**: For reading and writing Excel files (optional if you're working with `.xlsx` files).
  ```bash
  pip install openpyxl
  ```

* **io**: This is a built-in Python library, so you don't need to install it separately.
* **base64**: Also a built-in Python library, no need to install.
* **re**: A built-in module for working with regular expressions.

## SSH for Port Tunneling

You don't need to install anything for SSH port tunneling as it's built into most Unix-based systems like Linux and macOS. For Windows, you can use tools like PuTTY or install OpenSSH.

##Usage
Interact with the chatbot via the provided API endpoints.
Use Postman or any HTTP client to send requests to the local API.
